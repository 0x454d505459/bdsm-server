# Unmaintenance Notice
Im currently writing my own zig implementation of the bdsm-server, as such this repository won't be updated anymore.


# Basic Data Server Monitor (Server)

Can be used with the [Basic Data Server Monitor (Client)](http://github.com/firminsurgithub/bdsm-client) to monitor your server's CPU, RAM and Disk usage.

## Installation (Linux-systemD) <- Recommanded for most users

```
curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firminsurgithub/bdsm-server/master/install-linux.sh' | bash
```

To update BDSM-Server, run that command:

The preferences are stored in `/usr/share/bdsm-server/.env`

## Installation (nodejs) 

Create .env file in root directory and add the following variables:

```bash
SERVER_NAME="My Awesome Server"
